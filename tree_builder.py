"""
--- Design Memo (200‚Äì300 words) ---

Recursive insertion works by breaking the search problem into smaller subproblems.
Given a target manager‚Äôs name, we start at the root: if the current node matches
the manager, we check the requested side (left or right). If that side is empty,
we create a new EmployeeNode there; if it‚Äôs already occupied, we report an error.
If the current node is not the manager, we recursively search its left subtree,
and if not found, its right subtree. Each recursive call reduces the search
space until either we find the manager or we exhaust the tree. The function
returns True/False to signal success up the call stack so we can stop as soon
as we insert successfully.

The main challenge was ensuring we only print helpful error messages once and
avoid noisy output during deep recursion (e.g., ‚Äúmanager not found‚Äù repeated
many times). I handled this by only printing the ‚Äúmanager not found‚Äù message at
the top-level call (when current_node is the root), while lower-level calls
silently return False. Another common pitfall is normalizing user input for the
side (LEFT/RIGHT vs left/right); I standardized by lowercasing and validating.

Trees are preferable when hierarchical relationships must be represented
clearly and traversed efficiently. Examples include org charts, file systems,
dependency trees, and decision trees. Compared to linear structures (lists),
trees let us organize data by parent/child relationships and support recursive
operations (search/insert/print) that mirror real-world hierarchies. Compared
to hash maps, trees naturally preserve structure and ordering and can support
ordered traversals or proximity queries (e.g., nearest ancestor/descendant).
